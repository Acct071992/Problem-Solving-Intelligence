/* find square root of a given number without using built-in function

Approach:
as min can be 1 and max can be x/2
and so continuous set can be observed hence binary search applicable.

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int squareRoot(int a)
{
    if(a<2) return a;
    int low = 1, high = a/2;
    int ans = 0;
    while(low<=high){
        int mid = (low+high)/2;
        int prod = mid * mid;
        if(prod==a) return mid;
        if(prod<a) ans = mid, low = mid+1;
        else high = mid-1;
    }
    return ans;
}
